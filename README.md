## Introduction

## UX
### Strategy Plane
When approaching the main strategy and the initial phase of this project I thought about something that would be able to help the user get useful information in a very brief span of time. The main idea to create a quote generator for home renovation projects came to me because of my father who has been in this specific business his whole life. 
### Scope Plane
As a specific scope the website aims to provide a range of options to choose from and to establish the quantity needed. The final output is then given back to the user based on the information that they provided. The general goals were to create a platform easy to use and that would elicit a positive response from the user.
### Structure Plane
The decisions on the general structure of the project where taken considering a layout that would have allowed to implement future features and mostly a user interface that was easy to maintain and access. With responsiveness is mind the information is layered on a series of interfaces with matching structure as to maintain a sense of familiarity while interacting with the different sections of the website
### Skeleton Plane
Various blocks of the project have been designed to accomodate inputs from the user. In addition to that, below the interactive part of the website I have also included a section that provides information about the current possible interactions of the projects. The website develops mainly in a vertical fashion to allow better responsiveness for mobile.
### Surface Plane
#### Fonts, Colors and Style Choices
Starting from the font used, the idea was to utilize a style that would make the user feel that "old school" appereance. Any full cursive type of font would have the defeated the purpose of immediate access to the information. Knowing that the first few seconds on a website are crucial I took the decision to go with Nanum Myeongjo because it was on of the few that hit the right spot between style and functionality.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to provide an accessible quote generator through an interactive single webpage. The website would provide an easy-to-use interface through which the clients have the possibility of calculating the total cost of the materials they need to complete a home diy renovation project or for a contractor to know the amount of capital to invest in a specific job. Due to the infinite amount of variables to include in the time needed for the project it would have been unwise of me to try an estimate that on the project. 
### Target Audience
Home renovation is a very complex topic and the decision about which type of clientele to target was a difficult one. After careful consideration came to the conclusion that the 2 major targets for this project are: 
* New home buyers
* 60+ citizens

The reason behind this seemingly odd choice was dictated by the fact that in both cases there are plenty of circumstances in which the subjects would start a renovation journey. In the first case, for first time home owners it is typical for them to close a mortgage on a house with plenty of restyling already in mind and given the young age, a large group of them is inclined to carry the burden of a DIY project. 

For the second type of possible audience for this website, the reasoning behind was that once retirement is near or already the present condition is not unusual to start contacting companies to work on house that has seen many years of use and tear. In this case the senior citizen could definitely make the most out of a simple and immediate platform to estimate the cost and scope of the renovation.
