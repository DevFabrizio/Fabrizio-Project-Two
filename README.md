## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to provide an accessible quote generator through an interactive single webpage. The website would provide an easy-to-use interface through which the clients have the possibility of calculating the total cost of the materials they need to complete a home diy renovation project or for a contractor to know the amount of capital to invest in a specific job. Due to the infinite amount of variables to include in the time needed for the project it would have been unwise of me to try an estimate that on the project.
