#### Fonts, Colors and Style Choices
Starting from the font used, the idea was to utilize a style that would make the user feel that "old school" appereance. Any full cursive type of font would have the defeated the purpose of immediate access to the information. Knowing that the first few seconds on a website are crucial I took the decision to go with Nanum Myeongjo because it was on of the few that hit the right spot between style and functionality.

## Project Goals
The main goal of this project is to provide an accessible quote generator through an interactive single webpage. The website would provide an easy-to-use interface through which the clients have the possibility of calculating the total cost of the materials they need to complete a home diy renovation project or for a contractor to know the amount of capital to invest in a specific job. Due to the infinite amount of variables to include in the time needed for the project it would have been unwise of me to try an estimate that on the project.
